The primary challenge is classification of crime type: you are required to build a learning system that, given crime feature
vectors (see below description) predicts which kind of crime it is, from 5 classes. The secondary
challenge is crime prevention. Every day you can send 30 police cars to the city - you direct a car to
a specific location and a specific time of day. If a crime was about to happen up to 500m from the
location you specified and up to 30 minutes before or after the time you specified, you prevented a
crime! You are required to build a learning system that, given a date in the future, will output 30
(x,y,time) combinations - where time is during that day from midnight to midnight. Police cars will
be sent to these locations at these times.
